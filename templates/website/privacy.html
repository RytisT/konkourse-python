              <h2>Konkourse Privacy Policy</h2>
              <p>Updated August 15th, 2013.</p>
              <p>Konkourse.com (&ldquo;Konkourse&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) provides a website which enables (&ldquo;Students&rdquo;) to manage their educational courses and other groups (&ldquo;courses&rdquo;) through our website, accessible at www.konkourse.com (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;; and the services provided through such Site, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;).  Using the Site, Students create courses where other Students can access materials and information related to the course, and where Students can post messages, documents, and events about course-related topics.  The goal of the site is to make communication between Students easier and more enjoyable.</p>
              <p>Konkourse provides this privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Site.  This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site.</p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  Any modification will be reflected on our website.  You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.  &ldquo;Member&rdquo;, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to a person that completes Konkourse&rsquo;s account registration process described under the &ldquo;Account Registration&rdquo; section of the Terms.</p>
              <p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms &ldquo;using&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
              <h3>Courses</h3>
               
              <p>Any course that a student creates or joins is considered to be, for all intents and purposes, public.  Other students attending the same institution have the ability to join a course that already exists or create a new course.  All information that students share within a course is considered to be public information.  In addition, any student who has joined or created a course can also leave a course with the option to return to the course at a later date and time.  (See the &ldquo;Information Sharing and Disclosure&rdquo; section below for further information.)  </p>
              <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
               
              <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Service, features and content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>
              <p>Personally Identifiable Information: <br />
                Personally identifiable information is information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;).</p>
              <p>When you register with us through the Site as a Member, we will ask you for Personal Information.  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, and the academic institution you are attending or have attended.  Depending on the course you join, we may ask you to provide the name of the course you have joined.  Additionally, you will be prompted to fill out information about your field of study and personal interests.</p>
              <p>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, individual preferences) (&ldquo;Non-Identifying Information&rdquo;).</p>
              <p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</p>
              <p>We may also use your Personal Information (e.g., your email address) to contact you with Konkourse newsletters, and Konkourse and our partners&rsquo; marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
              <p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).  We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users and by our third party service providers (such as Google Analytics and KissMetrics) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how the Site and Service are used.   We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>
              <p><em>Log Data:  </em><br />
                When you visit the Site, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers, or our third party service providers on our behalf, automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;).  This Log Data may include information such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (or &ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.  We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site&rsquo;s technical administration, to increase our Site&rsquo;s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our users&rsquo; needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and may serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to verify that users of the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.  We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
               
              <p>Like many websites, we, or our third party service providers on our behalf, use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.</p>
              <h3>Messaging Via Konkourse</h3>
               
              <p>As part of the Service, Members can communicate with each other by sending a message.  Members can communicate with each other and with other users by posting to a course page. Members may also receive notifications of course activity by email.</p>
              <h3>Phishing</h3>
               
              <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are of great concern to Konkourse.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s website.</p>
              <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
               
              <p>Konkourse Users:<br />
                As a Member, we will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site.  Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Konkourse users to know about you.  Please keep in mind that all course information is public when choosing what information to share.  Alternatively, profile information such as birthdate, interests, and about is private. Other members can view private information once a connection is made.  Members can review and revise their profile information at any time.</p>
              <p>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information:<br />
                We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>
              <p>Service Providers:<br />
                We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related service (e.g., without limitation, maintenance service, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site&rsquo;s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.  These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
              <p>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement:<br />
                Konkourse cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Konkourse or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
              <p>Business Transfers:<br />
                If the ownership of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so they can continue to operate the Service.</p>
              <h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
               
              <p>All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile through the Site.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at privacy@konkourse.com with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.  We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
              <h3>Security</h3>
               
              <p>Konkourse is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, however, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people.</p>
              <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
              <h3>International Transfer</h3>
               
              <p>Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Konkourse transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
              <h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
               
              <p>The Site and Service are not intended for use by persons who are 13 or younger.  Any access to or use of the Site or Service by anyone 13 or younger is expressly prohibited except in the limited circumstances described below.</p>
              <p>If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@konkourse.com.  If we become aware that a person under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take measures to delete such information from our files.</p>
              <h3>Contacting Us</h3>
               
              <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at privacy@konkourse.com.</p>
